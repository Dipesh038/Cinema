## 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. **Database Connection & Schema - FIXED** ✅

**Problem:**
- Database name typo: `db.js` used `CInema` instead of `Cinema`
- Missing `show_time` column in movies table
- "Add Movie" feature failing with "Unknown column 'show_time'" error

**Solution:**
- Fixed database name in `backend/db.js` from `CInema` → `Cinema`
- Added missing `show_time` column to movies table:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE movies ADD COLUMN show_time TIME NOT NULL DEFAULT '00:00:00';
  ```
- "Add Movie" now works correctly

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/db.js` - Fixed database name
- Database schema - Added `show_time` column

### 2. **Movie Filtering Logic - FIXED** ✅

**Problem:**
- Movies were not updating when switching between dates/times
- Showed movies from previous selections
- Movies appeared even when they didn't match selected date/time

**Solution:**
- Implemented **STRICT filtering** - both date AND time must exactly match
- Movies without proper date/time data are excluded
- Fixed time format comparison (HH:MM vs HH:MM:SS)
- Proper refresh triggers when date or time changes
- Load order fixed: times are set BEFORE filtering happens

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/script.js`
  - `filterMoviesByDateTime()` - Strict matching logic
  - `formatTimeForComparison()` - Consistent time format
  - `loadMovies()` - Correct initialization order
  - `selectDate()` - Triggers time update + filtering
  - `setupShowtimeHandlers()` - Immediate filtering on time click

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Movie Filtering (Frontend)

```javascript
When you select Oct 26 + 12:45 PM:
1. Date selected → triggers updateShowtimes()
2. updateShowtimes() disables unavailable times
3. Calls filterAndDisplayMovies()
4. STRICT filter: only movies with date=2025-10-26 AND time=12:45:00
5. Result: Shows only matching movies OR "No movies" message
```

### Time Selection
- ⚪ **Enabled times** - Have shows for selected date (clickable)
- 🚫 **Disabled times** - No shows (greyed out, non-clickable)
- Tooltip on disabled: "No shows at this time for the selected date"
